# cot

**cot** stands (1) for “C*O*lors Toolbox”; it's a very minimalist application that provides the following features:

+ color picker
+ colors contrast test
+ color palettes management (create, edit)
+ color format conversion

It can be used as a command line tool as well as with its GUI; its aims is to be fast, lightweight, reliable, and easy to use.
